Welcome to My GitHub page!

As a former professional volleyball player, I bring discipline, teamwork, and a commitment to excellence in my role as a Full Stack Engineer. With over 5 years of experience in Front End Development and front-end infrastructure, I am passionate about creating innovative solutions.

Currently, I am a member of the AI Taskforce, where I lead the development of POCs for AI tools and methodologies. I also conduct workshops to share knowledge with our engineering group and build robust applications using JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Node.js. Additionally, I manage a cross-company AI-based end-to-end testing framework that enhances development efficiency.

I integrate various AI tools into my work daily, including n8n, Agents, LLM workflows, Warp, Dia, Claude, and Cursor.

Outside of work, I enjoy staying active, reading, spending time with my dog, and building detailed Lego sets.
