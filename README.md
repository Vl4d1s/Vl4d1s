Welcome to My GitHub page!

I’m a Full Stack Engineer, frontend-oriented, with 5+ years of experience building scalable applications and engineering infrastructure. My focus is on creating reliable, high-performance systems while driving innovation through applied AI.

At Earnix, I lead AI initiatives within the engineering taskforce, developing POCs, integrating AI tools into workflows, and building a cross-company testing framework that improved development speed and quality across teams. Previously at Wix, I contributed to the Frontend Infrastructure group.

My expertise spans modern web development (JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js) and AI-driven systems, including multi-agent architectures, RAG pipelines, and evaluation frameworks. I also run workshops to mentor engineers adopting AI-driven practices.

As a former professional athlete, I bring discipline, resilience, and teamwork into everything I do. Whether it’s scaling web applications, pioneering new AI methodologies, or helping teams ship smarter and faster, I’m motivated by creating lasting impact. My mission is simple: engineer solutions that move both technology and people forward.
